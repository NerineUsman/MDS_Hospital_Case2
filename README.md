##Â Data preprocessing

The preprocessing of the data is performed in `preprocessing.ipynb`. We take all the data provided by the hospital and extract the relevant features of each measurement/sample/experiment/data point (a single CT slice).
The file `aux_preprocessing.py` is an auxiliary file used for preprocessing.
