# MDS_Hospital_Case2

### Data preprocessing

The preprocessing of the data is performed in `preprocessing_CT.ipynb`. We take all the data provided by the hospital and extract the relevant features of each data point (single CT slice).
The file `aux_preprocessing.py` is an auxiliary file used for preprocessing.

The data is then stored as pickle files in `data/`. See `preprocessing_CT.ipynb` to check how the data is stored and how to read it.
